# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? i felt frustrated at first but realized that it is good to problemsolve to figure out the right course of action.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? it is going well, i take a long time on assignments but i really enjoy it. but from a corporate point of view i would look bad!
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? i want to remember that i have to add commas after every value in the key value pairs.
